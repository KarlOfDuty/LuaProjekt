# LuaProjekt

A small SFML based game to show off some Lua scripting.

### Controls:

Arrow keys to move, space to slice with sword.

### Lua Scripts

The Lua scripts Player and Enemy can be customised to change behaviour and attacks of the player and enemies, for instance enemies are set to do more damage but have slower projectiles the bigger the enemy is.

Enemy difficulty is also calculated by how many corners it's geometric shape has.
